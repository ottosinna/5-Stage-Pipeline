# 5-Stage-Pipeline
A basic simulation of instruction pipelining in computer architecture is implemented by this code. In addition to calculating their pipelined stages and displaying the pipeline stages chart and overall cycle count, it enables users to enter assembly-like instructions. Each instruction is represented by the instruction structure as a node in a linked list that 
includes the pipeline stages, the instruction text, and a pointer to the subsequent instruction. A menu with options to add instructions, check the pipeline chart, compute the number of
cycles, clear all instructions, and exit allows users to interact with the application. The order of the instructions determines the pipeline stages, and memory for the instructions and 
pipeline stages is dynamically allocated.
